Project Overview

The Ticketing System is a multi-threaded application designed to simulate ticket transactions in real-time. Vendors can add tickets to a shared pool, while customers purchase tickets at specified intervals. The system ensures that the total number of tickets does not exceed the defined maximum capacity, maintaining robust concurrency management and data integrity in a multi-threaded environment.

Acknowledgements

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my lecturer, Mr. Guhanathan Poravi, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout the Object-Oriented Programming module. His insights and constructive feedback have been instrumental in shaping my understanding and approach to this project.
Thank you also to the resources and opportunities provided during this module. This assignment has been an enriching experience, helping me enhance both my coding and research skills.
